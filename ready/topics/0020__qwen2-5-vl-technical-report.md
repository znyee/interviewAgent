Abstract
We introduce Qwen2.5-VL, the latest flagship model of Qwen vision-language series
which demonstrates significant advancements in both foundational capabilities and
innovative functionalities. Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap forward in understanding
and interacting with the world through enhanced visual recognition, precise object local-
ization, robust document parsing, and long-video comprehension. A standout feature of
Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to localize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It
provides robust structured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as
detailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts. To handle complex inputs, Qwen2.5-
VL introduces dynamic resolution processing and absolute time encoding, enabling it

rating Window Attention, we have significantly reduced computational overhead while
maintaining native resolution. As a result, Qwen2.5-VL excels not only in static image
and document understanding but also as an interactive visual agent capable of reasoning
tool usage, and task execution in real-world scenarios such as operating computers and
mobile devices. The model achieves strong generalization across domains without requir-
ing task-specific fine-tuning. Qwen2.5-VL is available in three sizes, addressing diverse
use cases from edge AI to high-performance computing. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B

1 Introduction
Large vision-language models ( LVLMs ) (OpenAI, 2024; Anthropic, 2024a; Team et al., 2023; Wang et al.
2024f) represent a pivotal breakthrough in artificial intelligence, signaling a transformative approach to
multimodal understanding and interaction. By seamlessly integrating visual perception with natural
language processing, these advanced models are fundamentally reshaping how machines interpret and
analyze complex information across diverse domains. Despite significant advancements in multimodal
large language models, the current capabilities of these models can be likened to the middle layer of a
sandwich cookie—competent across various tasks but falling short of exceptional performance. Fine-
grained visual tasks form the foundational layer of this analogy. In this iteration of Qwen2.5-VL, we
are committed to exploring fine-grained perception capabilities, aiming to establish a robust foundation
for LVLMs and create an agentic amplifier for real-world applications. The top layer of this framework
is multi-modal reasoning, which is enhanced by leveraging the latest Qwen2.5 LLM and employing
multi-modal QA data construction.
A spectrum of works have promoted the development of multimodal large models, characterized by
architectural design, visual input processing, and data curation. One of the primary drivers of progress
in LVLMs is the continuous innovation in architecture. The studies presented in (Alayrac et al., 2022
Li et al., 2022a; 2023b; Liu et al., 2023b;a; Wang et al., 2024i; Zhang et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2023) have
incrementally shaped the current paradigm, which typically consists of a visual encoder, a cross-modal
projector, and LLM. Fine-grained perception models have emerged as another crucial area. Models like
(Xiao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023c; Ren et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a;d; Peng et al., 2023; Deitke et al.
2024) have pushed the boundaries of what is possible in terms of detailed visual understanding. The
architectures of Omni (Li et al., 2024g; 2025b; Ye et al., 2024) and MoE (Riquelme et al., 2021; Lee et al.
2024; Li et al., 2024h;c; Wu et al., 2024b) also inspire the future evolution of LVLMs. Enhancements in
visual encoders (Chen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b; Liang et al., 2025) and resolution scaling (Li et al.
2023c; Ye et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a) have played a pivotal role in improving the quality of practical
visual understanding. Curating data with more diverse scenarios and higher-quality is an essential step
in training advanced LVLMs. The efforts proposed in (Guo et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024d; Liu et al., 2024a
Chen et al., 2024a; Tong et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a) are highly valuable contributions to this endeavor.
However, despite their remarkable progress, vision-language models currently face developmental
bottlenecks, including computational complexity, limited contextual understanding, poor fine-grained
visual perception, and inconsistent performance across varied sequence length.
In this report, we introduce the latest work Qwen2.5-VL, which continues the open-source philosophy of
the Qwen series, achieving and even surpassing top-tier closed-source models on various benchmarks.
Technically, our contributions are four-folds: (1) We implement window attention in the visual encoder to
optimize inference efficiency; (2) We introduce dynamic FPS sampling, extending dynamic resolution to
the temporal dimension and enabling comprehensive video understanding across varied sampling rates
(3) We upgrade MRoPE in the temporal domain by aligning to absolute time, thereby facilitating more
sophisticated temporal sequence learning; (4) We make significant efforts in curating high-quality data
for both pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, further scaling the pre-training corpus from 1.2 trillion
tokens to 4.1 trillion tokens.
The sparkling characteristics of Qwen2.5-VL are as follows
• Powerful document parsing capabilities: Qwen2.5-VL upgrades text recognition to omni-
document parsing, excelling in processing multi-scene, multilingual, and various built-in (hand-
writing, tables, charts, chemical formulas, and music sheets) documents.
• Precise object grounding across formats: Qwen2.5-VL unlocks improved accuracy in detecting
pointing, and counting objects, accommodating absolute coordinate and JSON formats for
advanced spatial reasoning.
• Ultra-long video understanding and fine-grained video grounding: Our model extends native
dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension, enhancing the ability to understand videos lasting
hours while extracting event segments in seconds.
• Enhanced agent Functionality for computer and mobile devices:Leverage advanced grounding
reasoning, and decision-making abilities, boosting the model with superior agent functionality
on smartphones and computers.

Figure 1: The Qwen2.5-VL framework demonstrates the integration of a vision encoder and a language
model decoder to process multimodal inputs, including images and videos. The vision encoder is
designed to handle inputs at their native resolution and supports dynamic FPS sampling. Images of
varying sizes and video frames with different FPS rates are dynamically mapped to token sequences
of varying lengths. Notably, MRoPE aligns time IDs with absolute time along the temporal dimension
enabling the model to better comprehend temporal dynamics, such as the pace of events and precise
moment localization. The processed visual data is subsequently fed into the Qwen2.5 LM Decoder. We
have re-engineered the vision transformer (ViT) architecture, incorporating advanced components such
as FFN with SwiGLU activation, RMSNorm for normalization, and window-based attention mechanisms
to enhance performance and efficiency.
2 Approach
In this section, we first outline the architectural updates of the Qwen2.5-VL series models and provide an
overview of the data and training details.
2.1 Model Architecture
The overall model architecture of Qwen2.5-VL consists of three components
Large Language Model : The Qwen2.5-VL series adopts large language models as its foundational
component. The model is initialized with pre-trained weights from the Qwen2.5 LLM. To better meet the
demands of multimodal understanding, we have modified the 1D RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) to
our Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding Aligned to Absolute Time.
Vision Encoder: The vision encoder of Qwen2.5-VL employs a redesigned Vision Transformer (ViT)
architecture. Structurally, we incorporate 2D-RoPE and window attention to support native input
resolutions while accelerating the computation of the entire visual encoder. During both training and
inference, the height and width of the input images are resized to multiples of 28 before being fed into the
ViT. The vision encoder processes images by splitting them into patches with a stride of 14, generating a
set of image features. We provide a more detailed introduction to the vision encoder in Section 2.1.1.
MLP-based Vision-Language Merger: To address the efficiency challenges posed by long sequences
of image features, we adopt a simple yet effective approach to compress the feature sequences before
feeding them into the large language model (LLM). Specifically, instead of directly using the raw patch
3

features extracted by the Vision Transformer (ViT), we first group spatially adjacent sets of four patch
features. These grouped features are then concatenated and passed through a two-layer multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) to project them into a dimension that aligns with the text embeddings used in the
LLM. This method not only reduces computational costs but also provides a flexible way to dynamically
compress image feature sequences of varying lengths.
In Table 1, the architecture and configuration of Qwen2.5-VL are detailed.

2.1.1 Fast and Efficient Vision Encoder
The vision encoder plays a pivotal role in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address
the challenges posed by computational load imbalances during training and inference due to native
resolution inputs, we have redesigned the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. A key issue arises from
the quadratic computational complexity associated with processing images of varying sizes. To mitigate
this, we introduce windowed attention in most layers, which ensures that computational cost scales
linearly with the number of patches rather than quadratically. In our architecture, only four layers employ
full self-attention, while the remaining layers utilize windowed attention with a maximum window
size of 112×112 (corresponding to 8×8 patches). Regions smaller than 112×112 are processed without
padding, preserving their original resolution. This design allows the model to operate natively at the
input resolution, avoiding unnecessary scaling or distortion.
For positional encoding, we adopt 2D Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) to effectively capture spatial
relationships in 2D space. Furthermore, to better handle video inputs, we extend our approach to 3D
patch partitioning. Specifically, we use 14×14 image patches as the basic unit, consistent with traditional
ViTs for static images. For video data, two consecutive frames are grouped together, significantly reducing
the number of tokens fed into the language model. This design not only maintains compatibility with
existing architectures but also enhances efficiency when processing sequential video data.
To streamline the overall network structure, we align the ViT architecture more closely with the design
principles of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we adopt RMSNorm (Zhang &Sennrich, 2019)
for normalization and SwiGLU (Dauphin et al., 2017) as the activation function. These choices enhance
both computational efficiency and compatibility between the vision and language components of the
model.
In terms of training, we train the redesigned ViT from scratch. The training process consists of several
stages, including CLIP pre-training, vision-language alignment, and end-to-end fine-tuning. To ensure
robustness across varying input resolutions, we employ dynamic sampling at native resolutions during
4

training. Images are randomly sampled according to their original aspect ratios, enabling the model
to generalize effectively to inputs of diverse resolutions. This approach not only improves the model’s
adaptability but also ensures stable and efficient training across different sizes of visual data.
2.1.2 Native Dynamic Resolution and Frame Rate
Qwen2.5-VL introduces advancements in both spatial and temporal dimensions to handle diverse
multimodal inputs effectively.
In the spatial domain, Qwen2.5-VL dynamically converts images of varying sizes into sequences of
tokens with corresponding lengths. Unlike traditional approaches that normalize coordinates, our model
directly uses the actual dimensions of the input image to represent bounding boxes, points, and other
spatial features. This allows the model to learn scale information inherently, improving its ability to
process images across different resolutions.
For video inputs, Qwen2.5-VL incorporates dynamic frame rate (FPS) training and absolute time encoding.
By adapting to variable frame rates, the model can better capture the temporal dynamics of video content.
Unlike other approaches that incorporate textual timestamps or utilize additional heads to enable
temporal grounding, we introduce a novel and efficient strategy that aligns MRoPE IDs directly with
the timestamps. This approach allows the model to understand the tempo of time through the intervals
between temporal dimension IDs, without necessitating any additional computational overhead.
2.1.3 Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding Aligned to Absolute Time
Positional embeddings are crucial for modeling sequential data in both vision and language modalities.
Building upon the Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (MRoPE) introduced in Qwen2-VL, we extend
its capabilities to better handle temporal information in videos.
The MRoPE in Qwen2-VL decomposes the position embedding into three distinct components: temporal
height, and width to effectively model multimodal inputs. For textual inputs, all three components use
identical position IDs, making MRoPE functionally equivalent to traditional 1D RoPE (Su et al., 2024).
For images, the temporal ID remains constant across visual tokens, while unique IDs are assigned to the
height and width components based on each token’s spatial position within the image. When processing
videos, which are treated as sequences of frames, the temporal ID increments for each frame, while the
height and width components follow the same assignment pattern as for static images.
However, in Qwen2-VL, the temporal position IDs in MRoPE were tied to the number of input frames
which did not account for the speed of content changes or the absolute timing of events within the video.
To address this limitation, Qwen2.5-VL introduces a key improvement: aligning the temporal component
of MRoPE with absolute time. As shown in Figure 1, by leveraging the intervals between temporal IDs
the model is able to learn consistent temporal alignment across videos with different FPS sampling rates.
2.2 Pre-Training
In this section, we first describe the construction of the pre-training dataset, followed by an overview of
the overall training pipeline and configuration.
2.2.1 Pre-Training Data
Compared to Qwen2-VL, we have significantly expanded the volume of our pre-training data, increasing
it from 1.2 trillion tokens to approximately 4 trillion tokens. Our pre-training dataset was constructed
through a combination of methods, including cleaning raw web data, synthesizing data, etc. The
dataset encompasses a wide variety of multimodal data, such as image captions, interleaved image-text
data, optical character recognition (OCR) data, visual knowledge (e.g., celebrity, landmark, flora, and
fauna identification), multi-modal academic questions, localization data, document parsing data, video
descriptions, video localization, and agent-based interaction data. Throughout the training process, we
carefully adjusted the composition and proportions of these data types at different stages to optimize
learning outcomes.
three key benefits: (1) enabling in-context learning with simultaneous visual and textual cues (Alayrac
et al., 2022), (2) maintaining strong text-only capabilities when images are missing (Lin et al., 2024), and
(3) containing a wide range of general information. However, much of the available interleaved data
5

lacks meaningful text-image associations and is often noisy, limiting its usefulness for complex reasoning
and creative generation.
To address these challenges, we developed a pipeline for scoring and cleaning data, ensuring only
high-quality, relevant interleaved data is used. Our process involves two steps: standard data cleaning (Li
et al., 2024e) followed by a four-stage scoring system using an internal evaluation model. The scoring
criteria include: (1) text-only quality, (2) image-text relevance, (3) image-text complementarity, and (4)
information density balance. This meticulous approach improves the model’s ability to perform complex
reasoning and generate coherent multimodal content.
The following is a description of these image-text scoring criteria
Image-text Relevance: A higher score indicates a stronger connection between the image and text, where
the image meaningfully supplements, explains or expands on the text rather than just decorating it.
Information Complementarity: A higher score reflects greater complementary information between the
image and text. Each should provide unique details that together create a complete narrative.
Balance of Information Density: A higher score means a more balanced distribution of information
between the image and text, avoiding excessive text or image information, and ensuring an appropriate
balance between the two.
Grounding Data with Absolute Position Coordinates We adopt native resolution training with the aim
of achieving a more accurate perception of the world. In contrast, relative coordinates fail to effectively
represent the original size and position of objects within images. To address this limitation, Qwen2.5-VL
uses coordinate values based on the actual dimensions of the input images during training to represent
bounding boxes and points. This approach ensures that the model can better capture the real-world scale
and spatial relationships of objects, leading to improved performance in tasks such as object detection
and localization.
To improve the generalizability of grounding capabilities, we have developed a comprehensive dataset
encompassing bounding boxes and points with referring expressions, leveraging both publicly available
datasets and proprietary data. Our methodology involves synthesizing data into various formats, includ-
ing XML, JSON, and custom formats, employing techniques such as copy-paste augmentation (Ghiasi
et al., 2021) and synthesis with off-the-shelf models such as Grounding DINO (Liu et al., 2023c) and
SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023). This approach facilitates a more robust evaluation and advancement of
grounding abilities.
To enhance the model’s performance on open-vocabulary detection, we expanded the training dataset to
include over 10,000 object categories. Additionally, to improve the model’s effectiveness in extreme object
detection scenarios, we synthesized non-existent object categories within the queries and constructed
image data containing multiple instances for each object.
To ensure superior point-based object grounding capabilities, we have constructed a comprehensive
pointing dataset comprising both publicly available and synthetic data. Specifically, the data source
includes public pointing and counting data from PixMo (Deitke et al., 2024), publicly accessible object
grounding data (from both object detection and instance segmentation tasks), and data synthesized by an
automated pipeline for generating precise pointing data towards certain image details.
Document Omni-Parsing Data To train Qwen2.5-VL, we synthesized a large corpus of document
data. Traditional methods for parsing document content typically rely on separate models to handle
layout analysis, text extraction, chart interpretation, and illustration processing. In contrast, Qwen2.5-
VL is designed to empower a general-purpose model with comprehensive capabilities for parsing
understanding, and converting document formats. Specifically, we incorporated a diverse array of
elements into the documents, such as tables, charts, equations, natural or synthetic images, music sheets
and chemical formulas. These elements were uniformly formatted in HTML, which integrates layout box
information and descriptions of illustrations into HTML tag structures. We also enriched the document
layouts according to typical reading sequences and included the coordinates corresponding to each
module, such as paragraphs and charts, in the HTML-based ground truth. This innovative approach
allows the complete information of any document, including its layout, text, charts, and illustrations
to be represented in a standardized and unified manner. As a result, Qwen2.5-VL achieves seamless
integration of multimodal document elements, thereby facilitating more efficient and accurate document
understanding and transformation.
Below is the QwenVL HTML format

This format ensures that all document elements are represented in a structured and accessible manner
enabling efficient processing and understanding by Qwen2.5-VL.
OCR Data Data from different sources are gathered and curated to enhance the OCR performance
including synthetic data, open-sourced data and in-house collected data. Synthetic data is generated
through a visual text generation engine to produce high-quality text images in the wild. To support
a wider range of languages and enhance multilingual capabilities, we have incorporated a large-scale
multilingual OCR dataset. This dataset includes support for diverse languages such as French, German
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Russian, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. The dataset is carefully
curated to ensure diversity and quality, utilizing both high-quality synthetic images and real-world
natural scene images. This combination ensures robust performance across various linguistic contexts
and improves the model’s adaptability to different text appearances and environmental conditions. For
chart-type data, we synthesized 1 million samples using visualization libraries including matplotlib
seaborn, and plotly, encompassing chart categories such as bar charts, relational diagrams, and heatmaps.
Regarding tabular data, we processed 6 million real-world samples through an offline end-to-end table
recognition model, subsequently filtering out low-confidence tables, overlapping tables, and tables with
insufficient cell density.
Video Data To ensure enhanced robustness in understanding video data with varying frames per second
(FPS), we dynamically sampled FPS during training to achieve a more evenly distributed representation of
FPS within the training dataset. Additionally, for videos exceeding half an hour in length, we specifically
constructed a set of long video captions by synthesizing multi-frame captions through a targeted synthesis
pipeline. Regarding video grounding data, we formulated timestamps in both second-based formats
and hour-minute-second-frame (hmsf) formats, ensuring that the model can accurately understand and
output time in various formats.
Agent Data We enhance the perception and decision-making abilities to build the agent capabilities of
Qwen2.5-VL. For perception, we collect screenshots on mobile, web, and desktop platforms. A synthetic
data engine is used to generate screenshot captions and UI element grounding annotations. The caption
task helps Qwen2.5-VL understand the graphic interface, while the grounding task helps it align the
appearance and function of elements. For decision-making, we first unify the operations across mobile
web, and desktop platforms into a function call format with a shared action space. A set of annotated
multi-step trajectories collected from open-source data and synthesized by agent framework (Wang et al.
2025; 2024b;c) on virtual environments are reformatted into a function format. We further generate a
7

reasoning process for each step through human and model annotators (Xu et al., 2024). Specifically
given a ground-truth operation, we highlight it on the screenshot. Then, we provide the global query
along with screenshots from before and after this operation, to the annotators and require them to write
reasoning content to explain the intention behind this operation. A model-based filter is used to screen
out low-quality reasoning content. Such reasoning content prevents Qwen2.5-VL from overfitting to the
ground-truth operations and makes it more robust in real-world scenarios.

2.2.2 Training Recipe
We trained a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch using DataComp (Gadre et al., 2023) and some
in-house datasets as the initialization for the vision encoder, while leveraging the pre-trained Qwen2.5
large language model (LLM) (Yang et al., 2024a) as the initialization for the LLM component. As shown
in Table 2, the pre-training process is divided into three distinct phases, each employing different data
configurations and training strategies to progressively enhance the model’s capabilities.
In the first phase, only the Vision Transformer (ViT) is trained to improve its alignment with the language
model, laying a solid foundation for multimodal understanding. The primary data sources during this
phase include image captions, visual knowledge, and OCR data. These datasets are carefully selected to
foster ViT’s ability to extract meaningful visual representations that can be effectively integrated with
textual information.
In the second phase, all model parameters are unfrozen, and the model is trained on a diverse set of mul-
timodal image data to enhance its capacity to process complex visual information. This phase introduces
more intricate and reasoning-intensive datasets, such as interleaved data, multi-task learning datasets
visual question answering (VQA), multimodal mathematics, agent-based tasks, video understanding
and pure-text datasets. These datasets strengthen the model’s ability to establish deeper connections
between visual and linguistic modalities, enabling it to handle increasingly sophisticated tasks.
In the third phase, to further enhance the model’s reasoning capabilities over longer sequences, video
and agent-based data are incorporated, alongside an increase in sequence length. This allows the model
to tackle more advanced and intricate multimodal tasks with greater precision. By extending the sequence
length, the model gains the ability to process extended contexts, which is particularly beneficial for tasks
requiring long-range dependencies and complex reasoning.
To address the challenges posed by varying image sizes and text lengths, which can lead to imbalanced
computational loads during training, we adopted a strategy to optimize training efficiency. The primary
computational costs arise from the LLM and the vision encoder. Given that the vision encoder has
relatively fewer parameters and that we introduced window attention to further reduce its computational
demands, we focused on balancing the computational load of the LLM across different GPUs. Specifically
we dynamically packed data samples based on their corresponding input sequence lengths to the LLM
ensuring consistent computational loads. In the first and second phases, data were uniformly packed
to a sequence length of 8,192, while in the third phase, the sequence length was increased to 32,768 to
accommodate the model’s enhanced capacity for handling longer sequences.
2.3 Post-training
The post-training alignment framework of Qwen2.5-VL employs a dual-stage optimization paradigm
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al.
2023). This hierarchical alignment strategy synergizes parameter-efficient domain adaptation with human
preference distillation, addressing both representational grounding and behavioral refinement through
distinct optimization objectives.
8

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) aims to bridge the gap between pretrained representations and downstream
task requirements through targeted instruction optimization. During this phase, we employ the ChatML
format (Openai, 2024) to structure instruction-following data, deliberately diverging from the pretraining
data schema while maintaining architectural consistency with Qwen2-VL (Wang et al., 2024e). This
format transition enables three critical adaptations: 1) Explicit dialogue role tagging for multimodal turn-
taking, 2) Structured injection of visual embeddings alongside textual instructions, and 3) Preservation of
cross-modal positional relationships through format-aware packing. By exposing the model to curated
multimodal instruction-response pairs under this enhanced schema, SFT enables efficient knowledge
transfer while maintaining the integrity of pre-trained features.
2.3.1 Instruction Data
The Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase employs a meticulously curated dataset designed to enhance
the model’s instruction-following capabilities across diverse modalities. This dataset comprises approxi-
mately 2 million entries, evenly distributed between pure text data (50%) and multimodal data (50%)
which includes image-text and video-text combinations. The inclusion of multimodal data enables the
model to process complex inputs effectively. Notably, although pure text and multimodal entries are
equally represented, multimodal entries consume significantly more tokens and computational resources
during training due to the embedded visual and temporal information. The dataset is primarily com-
posed of Chinese and English data, with supplementary multilingual entries to support broader linguistic
diversity.
The dataset is structured to reflect varying levels of dialogue complexity, including both single-turn
and multi-turn interactions. These interactions are further contextualized by scenarios ranging from
single-image inputs to multi-image sequences, thereby simulating realistic conversational dynamics.
The query sources are primarily drawn from open-source repositories, with additional contributions
from curated purchased datasets and online query data. This combination ensures broad coverage and
enhances the representativeness of the dataset.
To address a wide range of application scenarios, the dataset includes specialized subsets for General
Visual Question Answering (VQA), image captioning, mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks
and security-related queries. Additionally, dedicated datasets for Document and Optical Character
Recognition (Doc and OCR), Grounding, Video Analysis, and Agent Interactions are constructed to
enhance domain-specific proficiency. Detailed information regarding the data can be found in the
relevant sections of the paper. This structured and diverse composition ensures that the SFT phase
effectively aligns pre-trained representations with the nuanced demands of downstream multimodal
tasks, fostering robust and contextually aware model performance.
2.3.2 Data Filtering Pipeline
The quality of training data is a critical factor influencing the performance of vision-language models.
Open-source and synthetic datasets typically exhibit significant variability, often containing noisy, redun-
dant, or low-quality samples. Therefore, rigorous data cleaning and filtering processes are essential to
address these issues. Low-quality data can lead to suboptimal alignment between pretrained representa-
tions and downstream task requirements, thereby diminishing the model’s ability to effectively handle
complex multimodal tasks. Consequently, ensuring high-quality data is paramount for achieving robust
and reliable model performance.
To address these challenges, we implement a two-stage data filtering pipeline designed to systematically
enhance the quality of the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) dataset. This pipeline comprises the following
stages
Stage 1: Domain-Specific Categorization In the initial stage, we employ Qwen2-VL-Instag, a specialized
classification model derived from Qwen2-VL-72B, to perform hierarchical categorization of question-
answer (QA) pairs. This model organizes QA pairs into eight primary domains, such as Coding and
Planning, which are further divided into 30 fine-grained subcategories. For example, the primary domain
Coding is subdivided into subcategories including Code_Debugging, Code_Generation, Code_T ranslation, and
Code_Understanding. This hierarchical structure facilitates domain-aware and subdomain-aware filtering
strategies, enabling the pipeline to optimize data-cleaning processes tailored to each category’s specific
characteristics. Consequently, this enhances the quality and relevance of the supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
dataset.
Stage 2: Domain-Tailored Filtering The second stage involves domain-tailored filtering, which inte-
grates both rule-based and model-based approaches to comprehensively enhance data quality. Given
9

the diverse nature of domains such as Document Processing, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and
Visual Grounding, each may necessitate unique filtering strategies. Below, we provide an overview of the
general filtering strategies applied across these domains.
Rule-Based Filtering employs predefined heuristics to eliminate low-quality or problematic entries.
Specifically, for datasets related to Document Processing, OCR, and Visual Grounding tasks, repetitive
patterns are identified and removed to prevent distortion of the model’s learning process and ensure
optimal performance. Additionally, entries containing incomplete, truncated, or improperly formatted
responses—common in synthetic datasets and multimodal contexts—are excluded. To maintain relevance
and uphold ethical standards, queries and answers that are unrelated or could potentially lead to harmful
outputs are also discarded. This structured approach ensures that the dataset adheres to ethical guidelines
and meets task-specific requirements.
Model-Based Filtering further refines the dataset by leveraging reward models trained on the Qwen2.5-
VL series. These models evaluate multimodal QA pairs across multiple dimensions. Queries are assessed
for complexity and relevance, retaining only those examples that are appropriately challenging and
contextually pertinent. Answers are evaluated based on correctness, completeness, clarity, relevance
to the query, and helpfulness. In visual-grounded tasks, particular attention is given to verifying the
accurate interpretation and utilization of visual information. This multi-dimensional scoring ensures that
only high-quality data progresses to the SFT phase.
2.3.3 Rejection Sampling for Enhanced Reasoning
To complement our structured data filtering pipeline, we employ rejection sampling as a strategy to
refine the dataset and enhance the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM). This
approach is particularly critical for tasks requiring complex inference, such as mathematical problem-
solving, code generation, and domain-specific visual question answering (VQA). Prior research has
shown that incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Wei et al. (2022) reasoning significantly improves a
model’s inferential performance. (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024) Our post-training experiments confirm this
underscoring the importance of structured reasoning processes for achieving high-quality outcomes.
The rejection sampling process begins with datasets enriched with ground truth annotations. These
datasets are carefully curated to include tasks that demand multi-step reasoning, such as mathematical
problem-solving, code generation, and domain-specific VQA. Using an intermediate version of the
Qwen2.5-VL model, we evaluate the generated responses against the ground truth. Only samples where
the model’s output matches the expected answers are retained, ensuring the dataset consists solely of
high-quality, accurate examples.
To further improve data quality, we apply additional constraints to filter out undesirable outputs.
Specifically, we exclude responses that exhibit code-switching, excessive length, or repetitive patterns.
These criteria ensure clarity and coherence in the CoT reasoning process, which is crucial for downstream
applications.
A key challenge in applying CoT reasoning to vision-language models is their reliance on both textual
and visual modalities. Intermediate reasoning steps may fail to adequately integrate visual information
either by ignoring relevant visual cues or misinterpreting them. To address this, we have developed
rule-based and model-driven filtering strategies to validate the accuracy of intermediate reasoning steps.
These mechanisms ensure that each step in the CoT process effectively integrates visual and textual
modalities. Despite these efforts, achieving optimal modality alignment remains an ongoing challenge
that requires further advancements.
The data generated through rejection sampling significantly enhances the model’s reasoning proficiency.
By iteratively refining the dataset and removing low-quality or erroneous samples, we enable the model
to learn from high-fidelity examples that emphasize accurate and coherent reasoning. This methodology
not only strengthens the model’s ability to handle complex tasks but also lays the groundwork for future
improvements in vision-language modeling.
2.3.4 Training Recipe
The post-training process for Qwen2.5-VL consists of two phases: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), both with the Vision Transformer (ViT) parameters frozen. In the
SFT phase, the model is fine-tuned on diverse multimodal data, including image-text pairs, video, and
pure text, sourced from general VQA, Rejection Sampling, and specialized datasets such as Document
and OCR, Grounding, Video, and Agent-related tasks. The DPO phase focuses exclusively on image-text
and pure text data, utilizing preference data to align the model with human preferences, with each sample
processed only once to ensure efficient optimization. This streamlined process enhances the model’s
10

cross-modal reasoning and task-specific performance while maintaining alignment with user intent.

3.3.3 Spatial Understanding
Understanding spatial relationships is crucial for developing AI models that can interpret and interact
with the world as humans do. In Large Vision-Language Models, visual grounding allows for the precise
localization and identification of specific objects, regions, or elements within an image based on natural
language queries or descriptions. This capability transcends traditional object detection by establishing
a semantic relationship between visual content and linguistic context, facilitating more nuanced and
contextually aware visual reasoning. We evaluated Qwen2.5-VL’s grounding capabilities on the referring
expression comprehension benchmarks (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014; Mao et al., 2016), object detection in the
wild (Li et al., 2022b), self-curated point grounding benchmark, and CountBench (Paiss et al., 2023).
We compare Qwen2.5-VL’s visual grounding capabilities with other leading LVLMs including Gemini
Grounding-DINO (Liu et al., 2023c), Molmo (Deitke et al., 2024), and InternVL2.5.
Qwen2.5-VL achieves leading performance across different benchmarks from box-grounding, and point-
grounding to counting. By equipping Qwen2.5-VL with both box and point-grounding capability, it
is able to understand, locate, and reason on the very details of certain parts of an image. For open-
vocabulary object detection, Qwen2.5-VL achieves a good performance of 43.1 mAP on ODinW-13
surpassing most LVLMs and quickly narrowing the gap between generalist models and specialist models.
In addition, Qwen2.5-VL unlocks the point-based grounding ability so that it could precisely locate the
very details of a certain object, which was difficult to represent by a bounding box in the past. Qwen2.5-
VL’s counting ability also makes great progress, achieving a leading accuracy of 93.6 on CountBench with
Qwen2.5-VL-72B using a “detect then count”-style prompt.
3.3.4 Video Understanding and Grounding

performed on platforms including AndroidWorld (Rawles et al., 2024), MobileMiniWob++ (Rawles et al.
2024), and OSWorld (Xie et al., 2025). We compare the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B againsts other
prominent models, such as GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), Gemini 2.0 (Deepmind, 2024), Claude (Anthropic
2024b), Aguvis-72B (Xu et al., 2024), and Qwen2-VL-72B (Wang et al., 2024e). The results are demonstrated
in Table 9.
Table 9: Performance of Qwen2.5-VL and other models on GUI Agent benchmarks.
Benchmarks GPT-4o Gemini 2.0 Claude Aguvis-72B Qwen2-VL-72B Qwen2.5-VL-72B
ScreenSpot 18.1 84.0 83.0 89.2 - 87.1
ScreenSpot Pro - - 17.1 23.6 1.6 43.6
Android Control HighEM 20.8 28.5 12.5 66.4 59.1 67.36
Android Control LowEM 19.4 60.2 19.4 84.4 59.2 93.7
AndroidWorldSR 34.5% (SoM) 26% (SoM) 27.9% 26.1% 6% (SoM) 35%
MobileMiniWob++SR 61% 42% (SoM) 61% (SoM) 66% 50% (SoM) 68%
OSWorld 5.03 4.70 14.90 10.26 2.42 8.83
The performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B demonstrates exceptional advancements across GUI grounding
benchmarks. It achieves 87.1% accuracy on ScreenSpot, competing strongly with Gemini 2.0 (84.0%)
and Claude (83.0%), while notably setting a new standard on ScreenSpot Pro with 43.6% accuracy -
far surpassing both Aguvis-72B (23.6%) and its foundation Qwen2-VL-72B (1.6%). Leveraging these
superior grounding capabilities, Qwen2.5-VL-72B significantly outperforms baselines across all offline
evaluation benchmarks with a large gap. In online evaluation, some baselines have difficulty completing
tasks due to limited grounding capabilities. Thus, we apply the Set-of-Mark (SoM) to the inputs of
these models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B can outperform the baselines on AndroidWorld
and MobileMiniWob++ and achieve comparable performance on OSWorld in online evaluation without
auxiliary marks. This observation suggests that Qwen2.5-VL-72B is able to function as an agent in real
and dynamic environments.
4 Conclusion
We present Qwen2.5-VL, a state-of-the-art vision-language model series that achieves significant advance-
ments in multimodal understanding and interaction. With enhanced capabilities in visual recognition
object localization, document parsing, and long-video comprehension, Qwen2.5-VL excels in both static
and dynamic tasks. Its native dynamic-resolution processing and absolute time encoding enable robust
handling of diverse inputs, while Window Attention reduces computational overhead without sacrificing
resolution fidelity. Qwen2.5-VL caters to a wide range of applications, from edge AI to high-performance
computing. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B matches or surpasses leading models like GPT-4o, and Claude
3.5 Sonnet, particularly in document and diagram understanding, while maintaining strong performance
on pure text tasks. The smaller Qwen2.5-VL-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-3B variants outperform similarly sized
models, demonstrating exceptional generalization and task execution across domains. Its innovations
pave the way for more intelligent and interactive systems, bridging perception and real-world application.
